Its back end is written using Node.js and Express.js., and users are able to log in and save their progress via its connected MongoDB database. It's still in development, but please, spend a few minutes trying it out! In addition to both the front and back-end code, the design, art, and music were all created by me.</p>

                    <p>Advance Wars RPS is a real-time, on-line, multiplayer, rock paper scissors game written in jQuery. Players input a user name, which is stored in a real-time Firebase database. The user is not password protected, but is persistent in the database, which keeps track of wins and losses over time. The nature of the database is also how players are able to play against each other in real time. Please note that two players are required to play the game. (Two browsers can be used.) This project is functional, but is missing animations. (Graphics property of Intelligent Systems and Nintendo.)</p>
